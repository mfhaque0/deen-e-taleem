### THERE IS NO ESCAPE

> **In the name of Allah, the Most Beneficent and Merciful**

_“_**_The life of this world is merely an amusement and a diversion; the true life is in the Hereafter if only they knew.”_** _(Quran_ [_29:64_](https://quran.com/29?startingVerse=64)_)._

Some people have always believed in God, while others have always denied His existence. We must understand that some individuals will never believe, regardless of the proof or evidence we present. This is because they do not want to believe in a Creator. They are unwilling to accept that one day they will have to answer for their actions and for their refusal to acknowledge their Benefactor, to whom they owe their very existence.

Humans tend to be very shortsighted when planning for their future. We plan for school, college, a career, family, children, and retirement. However, it tends to stop at that. Why don’t we plan for what we are certain will happen without a doubt? The answer is that we are scared of the unknown and are comfortable with what we know. **But, the reality is that there is no escape and worldly pleasure and achievements are temporary and should not be ultimate goal of lif### THERE IS NO ESCAPE

**_“He is the One˺ Who created death and life in order to test which of you is best in deeds. And He is the Almighty, All-Forgiving.”_** **(Quran** [67:2](https://quran.com/67?startingVerse=2)**)**

Islam teaches that this life is simply a test to determine our place in eternal life after death. Those who understand the reality ahead of them are aware that their ultimate fate after death is based on their actions in this life. Such individuals are thankful for all the blessings that God has given them and humbly worship Him while promoting goodness in all aspects of their lives. When a person embraces such a God-conscious way of life, their purpose extends beyond merely enjoying worldly pleasures. Their life is one of submission to God and they seek to positively contribute to the world around them. They are guided by the certainty that they will one day return to their Creator and be held accountable for their deeds.
