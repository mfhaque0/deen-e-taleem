> ### Introduction

What is happiness? What is your purpose in life? Is it buying a giant home or owning luxury cars? Is it accumulating wealth? When will you stop focusing on duniyah (worldly life)? How much is enough? Will the greed for more ever end?

People spend their entire lives chasing wealth, yet happiness remains elusive. These questions are not just thought-provoking; they challenge us to reflect on our lives and priorities. Are we truly living, or are we caught in an endless cycle of chasing worldly pleasures that leave us unfulfilled? In this article, we explore these profound questions to uncover the essence of happiness, purpose, achievement, and the balance between duniyah and akhirah (the hereafter)

### What is Happiness?

Happiness is often sought in external things — Grand lifestyles, social recognition, or Temporary pleasures like movies, clubbing, or smoking. Yet, these only provide temporary joy, leaving a void that cannot be filled by material possessions. True happiness lies in finding peace and contentment within, something that only faith and gratitude can provide.

Islam emphasizes the importance of inner peace through a connection with Allah: “**Those who believe and whose hearts find comfort in the remembrance of Allah. Surely in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find comfort.**” ([Surah Ar-Ra’d 13:28](https://quran.com/en/ar-rad/28)).

Happiness comes not from chasing what the world offers but from aligning your life with your spiritual purpose.

### What is Your Purpose?

Purpose is the foundation of a meaningful life. Why are we here? What are we striving for? In Islam, our purpose is crystal clear: **“I did not create jinn and humans except to worship Me.”** ([Surah Adh-Dhariyat 51:56](https://quran.com/en/adh-dhariyat/56)).

This doesn’t mean abandoning worldly pursuits but instead aligning them with our ultimate goal — pleasing Allah and attaining success in the hereafter. Living a life of purpose means understanding that our existence is not random or meaningless. It is a test, an opportunity to grow spiritually, contribute positively to society, and prepare for the eternal life awaiting us.

Unfortunately, many lose sight of this purpose, becoming consumed by worldly desires like wealth, fame, and status. They fail to realize that these are temporary, while our spiritual purpose has eternal significance. Purpose gives us clarity, direction, and a reason to wake up every morning. It reminds us to balance our worldly responsibilities with acts of worship, kindness, and self-improvement. A purposeful life isn’t just about personal success; it’s about living intentionally, contributing to the well-being of others, and ensuring our actions align with our ultimate goal — earning Allah’s pleasure and securing our place in Jannah (Paradise).

### What is Achievement?


Is achievement defined by buying a giant home, owning multiple cars, or amassing wealth? While society often equates success with material possessions, these are temporary and ultimately leave us wanting more. Greed never ends — it only grows more. The Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) said: _“_**_If Adam’s son had a valley full of gold, he would like to have two valleys, for nothing fills his mouth except dust.”_** ([Sahih al-Bukhari 6439](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6439))

True achievement is about earning Allah’s pleasure, building a legacy of good deeds, and contributing positively to the world. Allah reminds us:  
**“And whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger and fears Allah and is conscious of Him — it is those who are the successful ones.”**  ([Surah An-Nur 24:52](https://quran.com/an-nur/52))

**Real success lies in:**
- Building a career that benefits others.  
- Strengthening your relationship with Allah through acts of worship.  
- Living a life of purpose and integrity.  
- Leaving behind acts of kindness and charity (Sadaqah Jariyah).
The life of this world is no more than the delusion of enjoyment.  ([Quran 57:20](https://quran.com/al-hadid/20))

> **When Will You Stop Focusing on Duniyah?**

People spend their entire lives chasing wealth and worldly success, often forgetting that death is inevitable. When will we stop? When will we realize that no amount of wealth or possessions can bring eternal happiness? The Quran reminds us: **“Competition for more ˹gains˺ diverts you ˹from Allah˺ until you end up in ˹your˺ graves.”** ([Surah At-Takathur 102:1–2](https://quran.com/en/at-takathur/1-2)).

Chasing duniyah without considering the hereafter leads to a cycle of dissatisfaction. True contentment comes when we prioritize faith over greed and focus on what truly matters.
### Real-Life Example: Balancing Duniyah and Akhirah

There are many inspiring examples from the lives of the Sahabah (companions of the Prophet ﷺ) that demonstrate how worldly success can be harmonized with devotion to Allah and the hereafter.

One remarkable example is that of **Abdur Rahman ibn Auf (رضي الله عنه)**, a successful businessman known for his wealth and generosity. Despite his immense riches, he never allowed his wealth to distract him from his ultimate purpose. He used his earnings to support the Muslim community, frequently donating in the way of Allah. For instance, he once donated 700 camels loaded with goods to the Muslim army. His life showcases how wealth, when earned and spent responsibly, can become a source of immense reward in the hereafter.

Another inspiring example is that of **Uthman ibn Affan (رضي الله عنه)**, a wealthy merchant and one of the ten companions promised Jannah. Uthman was known for his humility and generosity. He used his wealth to help the Muslim community and make a positive difference in their lives. His actions showed how caring for others and using one’s resources for good is a great way to serve Allah and the ummah. He purchased a well for the people of Madinah when water was scarce and equipped the Muslim army during the Battle of Tabuk. Despite his prosperity, Uthman lived modestly and remained deeply connected to Allah through worship and good deeds. His generosity and focus on akhirah remind us that worldly success is most valuable when used as a means to earn Allah’s pleasure.

These examples demonstrate that worldly success is not inherently negative. When pursued with the right intentions and used for noble purposes, it becomes a means of attaining eternal reward.

### Conclusion

Life is a series of questions that challenge us to evaluate our priorities. Is happiness in material wealth or in faith? Is achievement about possessions or leaving behind a legacy of good deeds? When will we stop chasing duniyah and focus on preparing for akhirah?

While pursuing goals in the world is important, ensure that your actions do not lead to neglecting your duties towards Allah and your hereafter. Balance your career and personal goals with acts of worship, kindness, and charity. Consider how your worldly achievements can also serve a higher purpose, such as using your success to help others and make a positive impact.

The answers to these questions lie in shifting our focus from worldly desires to spiritual growth. Happiness, purpose, and fulfillment are found in living a life aligned with our faith, worshiping Allah, and contributing positively to the world. Let us reflect on these questions and choose a path that brings lasting peace and eternal success.

### Reflection and Dua

These questions will remind us to live intentionally. Ask yourself regularly:

> Am I fulfilling my purpose?

> Are my achievements aligned with my faith?

> Am I continuously growing and striving for better?

O Allah, guide us to live with purpose and intention. Help us balance our worldly responsibilities with our duties to You. Grant us the wisdom to prioritize our faith and the hereafter over the worldly desires. Make our lives meaningful in both this world and the next.

> Success is not measured by wealth or status but by the satisfaction of knowing you have lived a meaningful life.
